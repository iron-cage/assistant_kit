### Scope

- **Purpose**: Test case specs for user story doc instances in `docs/cli/user_story/`.
- **Responsibility**: Per-user-story test spec files covering end-to-end user workflows.
- **In Scope**: All 29 user stories: Interactive REPL, Print Mode Capture, Interactive With Message, Dry-run Preview, Project-specific Execution, Verbose Debugging, Fresh Session, Trace Execution, Custom System Prompt, Credential-isolated Execution, File Input, Code Block Extraction, Structured JSON Pipeline, Credential Refresh, Ask Mode, CLI Discoverability, Model Selection, Env-var Configuration, MCP Config Injection, Suppress Effort Max, Keep ClaudeCode Context, Session Isolation via Subdirectory, Output File Capture, Enum Output Validation, Session Concurrency Gate, Session Listing, Session Termination, Session Cross-Loading, Scope Inspection.
- **Out of Scope**: Parameter-level edge cases (-> `param/`), command-level integration (-> `command/`), type validation (-> `type/`).
