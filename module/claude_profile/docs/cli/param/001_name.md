# Parameter: 1. `name::`

Identifies the target account. Accepted as an explicit `name::EMAIL` pair, as a bare positional argument after the command name (no `name::` prefix required), or as a prefix shortcut (no `@`) that resolves to the first saved account whose name starts with that value.

- **Default:** **(required)** on `.account.use`, `.account.delete`; **inferred** on `.account.save` (reads `oauthAccount.emailAddress` from `~/.claude.json` as primary source; falls back to per-machine `_active` marker; exits 1 if neither present); **optional** on `.accounts` (omit to list all), `.account.limits` (omit for active account), `.account.relogin` (omit for active account), and `.account.inspect` (omit for active account)
- **Constraints:** Resolved value must be a valid email address (non-empty, must contain `@`, non-empty local part and domain); local part must not contain `/`, `\`, or `*` (path-unsafe characters rejected before any filesystem operation). Prefix input (no `@`) must be unambiguous — exits 1 when multiple saved accounts share the prefix.
- **Positional syntax:** On `.accounts`, `.account.use`, `.account.delete`, `.account.limits`, `.account.relogin`, and `.account.inspect` a bare argument after the command name is treated as the `name::` value. `clp .account.use alice@home.com` is equivalent to `clp .account.use name::alice@home.com`.
- **Prefix resolution:** When the supplied value contains no `@`, it is matched as a prefix against saved account names. The first alphabetically sorted match is used. If zero or multiple accounts match, the command exits 1 with a disambiguation error.
- **Purpose:** Selects the target credential file at `{credential_store}/{email}.credentials.json`. Name validation matches the library's `account::validate_name()` rules. An invalid name exits 1; a valid but unknown name exits 2.

**Comma-list for batch `owner::` operations (Feature 064):** When used with `owner::USER@MACHINE` or `owner::0`, `name::` accepts a comma-separated list to operate on multiple accounts in one invocation: `name::X,Y,Z`. Each account is resolved independently using the same rules (explicit email, prefix, or bare `@`-containing value). Comma-list is NOT supported for other params — `assignee::` explicitly has no batch mode.

**Examples:**

```text
name::alice@acme.com             → explicit form → {credential_store}/alice@acme.com.credentials.json
alice@acme.com                   → positional form (bare arg after command) → same as above
alice                            → prefix form → resolves to first saved account starting with "alice"
car                              → prefix form → resolves to e.g. carol@example.com
name::alice@a.com,bob@b.com,car  → comma-list form (batch owner:: only) → resolves 3 accounts
```
