# Feature: Usage Sort Strategies

### Scope

- **Purpose**: Provide configurable row ordering in `.usage` output, optimized for distinct operational workflows — long-running agent sessions, draining low-quota accounts, and exploiting upcoming quota resets.
- **Responsibility**: Documents the `sort::`, `desc::`, and `prefer::` parameters on `.usage`, including the 4 heuristic sort strategies, the `renew` default, and the `next` meta-strategy.
- **In Scope**: Sort strategies (`name`, `endurance`, `drain`, `renew`, `next`), direction control (`desc::`), model preference for weekly quota selection (`prefer::`), context-sensitive `desc::` defaults per strategy, three-tier universal display grouping (🟢 → 🟡 → 🔴 applied before sort within each tier, with h-exhausted sub-group before weekly-exhausted sub-group within 🟡), `renew` as the default strategy, `next` as a meta-strategy that mirrors the active `next::` algorithm so the `→` winner always appears first.
- **Out of Scope**: Row rendering (→ 009_token_usage.md), `→ Next` recommendation algorithm (→ 023_next_account_strategies.md), `.account.rotate` selection (→ 008_auto_rotate.md), `live::` monitor loop mechanics (→ 018_live_monitor.md).

### Design

`.usage` accepts a `sort::` parameter to control row ordering. The default (`sort::renew`) puts accounts with the soonest weekly quota reset at the top — maximizing throughput by consuming quota that will be replenished first. Alphabetical ordering (`sort::name`) is available for positional stability, especially in `live::1` monitor mode. Four heuristic strategies are available for single-shot decision-making, plus `sort::next` — a meta-strategy that dynamically mirrors whatever `next::` algorithm is active, guaranteeing the `→` recommended account always appears at the top of the table.

**Three-tier display grouping:** Regardless of the chosen sort strategy, accounts are first grouped by composite health tier: 🟢 tier (`5h Left > 15%` and `7d Left > 5%`) → 🟡 tier (either `5h Left ≤ 15%` or `7d Left ≤ 5%`) → 🔴 tier (error/missing token). Within the 🟡 tier, accounts are further ordered into two sub-groups: **h-exhausted** (`5h Left ≤ 15%`) first, then **weekly-exhausted** (`5h Left > 15%` and `7d Left ≤ 5%`). Accounts where both quotas are below threshold fall in the h-exhausted sub-group. Sort strategy applies within each sub-group. This ensures healthy accounts always appear above exhausted or errored accounts, regardless of sort direction or strategy.

**The `prefer::` parameter** determines which weekly quota column is used by all strategies that reference weekly availability:

| Value | Weekly column used | When |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| `any` (default) | `min(7d Left, 7d(Son))` | Conservative — whichever limit is more constrained |
| `opus` | `7d Left` | User intends to run Opus — only overall weekly quota matters |
| `sonnet` | `7d(Son)` | User intends to run Sonnet — Sonnet-specific weekly cap matters |

**The `desc::` parameter** controls sort direction. Each strategy has a context-sensitive default:

| Strategy | `desc::` default | Natural direction |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `name` | `0` (ascending) | A→Z reading order |
| `endurance` | `1` (descending) | Best-qualified on top |
| `drain` | `0` (ascending) | Drain targets on top |
| `renew` | `0` (ascending) | Soonest reset on top |

#### Strategy 1: `sort::name`

Alphabetical by account name, ascending. Stable positional layout across refreshes — useful for `live::1` where rows jumping every cycle would be disorienting.

#### Strategy 2: `sort::endurance`

**Goal:** Find accounts that can sustain a 5h+ uninterrupted session.

**Algorithm:**
1. Classify each account as **qualified** or **unqualified**:
   - Qualified: `5h Reset` is 15–60 minutes away AND `weekly(prefer)` ≥ 30%.
   - All others: unqualified.
2. Qualified accounts are ranked first. Within qualified: highest `weekly(prefer)` → soonest `5h Reset`.
3. Unqualified accounts follow, sorted by `5h Left` descending; tiebreak by highest `weekly(prefer)` first.

**Rationale:** An account whose 5h window resets in 15–60 minutes will soon have 100% fresh session quota. Combined with ≥30% weekly runway, it can sustain a full 5-hour agent run without hitting any limit. The 15-minute floor avoids accounts that reset imminently (race condition with session start).

#### Strategy 3: `sort::drain`

**Goal:** Use accounts with the lowest weekly (7d) quota first, preserving high-quota accounts for later.

**Algorithm:**
1. **h-exhausted** accounts (`5h Left` ≤ 15%): sunk to bottom.
2. Remaining accounts sorted by `7d Left` (prefer-aware, via `prefer::`) ascending (lowest first — drain these).
3. Tiebreak: `5h Left` ascending (among equal weekly quota, drain lower session ones first).

**Rationale:** Weekly quota is the scarcest resource — it doesn't reset for 7 days. Draining accounts with the lowest 7d runway first ensures the limited weekly budget is consumed before expiry, rather than targeting only session-depleted accounts (which reset every 5 hours anyway).

#### Strategy 4: `sort::renew`

**Goal:** Use accounts whose weekly quota (7d) refills soonest.

**Algorithm:**
1. **h-exhausted** accounts (`5h Left` ≤ 15%): sunk to bottom.
2. Remaining accounts sorted by `7d Reset` countdown ascending (soonest weekly quota reset first; no `resets_at` → placed at end of non-exhausted).
3. Tiebreak: `7d Left` (prefer-aware, via `prefer::`) ascending (among same reset time, drain more weekly-depleted first).

**Rationale:** An account whose weekly quota resets soon can be freely drained — the 7d budget will be replenished. This maximizes throughput by consuming quota that would otherwise expire unused before the weekly reset.

#### Strategy 5: `sort::next`

**Goal:** Guarantee the `→` recommended account always appears at the top of the table, regardless of which `next::` strategy is active.

**Algorithm:**
1. Resolve `sort::next` to the concrete sort strategy matching the active `next::` parameter: `next::drain` → `sort::drain`; `next::endurance` → `sort::endurance`.
2. Apply the resolved strategy's full algorithm (including h-exhausted sinking and tiebreaks).

**Rationale:** Keeps sort and recommendation aligned without requiring the user to specify both `sort::drain next::drain` (or both endurance variants) separately. When `sort::next` is used, the account the footer recommends is always visible at row 1.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-01**: `sort::drain` sorts rows by `7d Left` (prefer-aware) ascending within each tier; tiebreak is `5h Left` ascending. `sort::name` sorts alphabetically. When `sort::` is omitted, `renew` is used.
- **AC-02**: `sort::endurance` ranks qualified accounts (5h Reset 15–60 min, weekly(prefer) ≥ 30%) above unqualified accounts; within qualified, highest weekly first then soonest reset; within unqualified, highest `weekly(prefer)` first as tiebreaker when session quotas are equal.
- **AC-03**: `sort::drain` sorts by `7d Left` (prefer-aware) ascending; tiebreak is `5h Left` ascending; h-exhausted accounts (`5h Left` ≤ 15%) are sunk to the bottom.
- **AC-04**: `sort::renew` sorts by `7d Reset` countdown ascending (soonest weekly reset first); tiebreak is `7d Left` (prefer-aware) ascending; h-exhausted accounts (`5h Left` ≤ 15%) are sunk to the bottom.
- **AC-05**: `desc::1` reverses the sort direction within each tier; `desc::0` uses the strategy's natural direction. The three-tier grouping (🟢 → 🟡 → 🔴) and the 🟡 h-/weekly-exhausted sub-grouping are never reversed by `desc::`.
- **AC-06**: Each strategy has a context-sensitive `desc::` default: `name`→`0`, `endurance`→`1`, `drain`→`0`, `renew`→`0`.
- **AC-07**: `prefer::any` (default) uses `min(7d Left, 7d(Son))` as weekly quota; `prefer::opus` uses `7d Left`; `prefer::sonnet` uses `7d(Son)`.
- **AC-08**: `prefer::` affects `sort::endurance` (qualification gate ≥ 30%), `sort::drain` (primary sort key), and `sort::renew` (tiebreak). For drain: `prefer_weekly` is the primary sort key (ascending — lowest first); `5h Left` is the tiebreak. For renew: `7d Reset` countdown is the primary key; `prefer_weekly` is the tiebreak (ascending).
- **AC-09**: Invalid `sort::` value exits 1 with an error naming the valid values.
- **AC-10**: Invalid `prefer::` value exits 1 with an error naming the valid values.
- **AC-11**: `sort::` and `desc::` do not affect the `→` recommendation marker or footer — those are controlled by the `next::` parameter (see 023_next_account_strategies.md). The footer always shows both strategy recommendations (endurance, drain) regardless of `sort::` or `next::` values. The `next::endurance` and `next::drain` strategies reuse the same sort algorithms but select independently from the table sort order.
- **AC-12**: `sort::` and `desc::` work correctly with `live::1` — sort order is stable within each refresh cycle.
- **AC-13**: `format::json` output is NOT affected by `sort::` or `desc::` — `render_json` preserves the input slice order without re-sorting (alphabetical in practice since `fetch_all_quota` returns accounts alphabetically; stable schema for pipeline consumers).
- **AC-14**: Three-tier display grouping (🟢 → 🟡 → 🔴) is applied universally before any sort strategy. Accounts are grouped by composite health: 🟢 (`5h Left > 15%` and `7d Left > 5%`), 🟡 (either `5h Left ≤ 15%` or `7d Left ≤ 5%`), 🔴 (error). Within 🟡, h-exhausted accounts (`5h Left ≤ 15%`) appear before weekly-exhausted accounts (`5h Left > 15%` and `7d Left ≤ 5%`); accounts with both below threshold fall in the h-exhausted sub-group. Sort strategy applies within each sub-group.
- **AC-15**: `sort::next` resolves to the concrete sort strategy matching the active `next::` parameter: `next::drain` → `sort::drain`; `next::endurance` → `sort::endurance`. The resolution happens at param-parse time, so `sort::next` is never stored as a distinct strategy — it is transparent to all downstream logic. The `→` recommended account always appears at row 1 when `sort::next` is used.
