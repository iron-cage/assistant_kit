# Feature: Save Account

### Scope

- **Purpose**: Snapshot the current active credentials as a named account profile for later restoration.
- **Responsibility**: Documents the `account::save()` API and the `.account.save` CLI command (FR-7).
- **In Scope**: Credential copy, metadata snapshot (`~/.claude.json`, `settings.json`), org identity snapshot (`{name}.roles.json` via endpoint 005), name validation, directory init, CLI dry-run behaviour, idempotent re-save as metadata refresh.
- **Out of Scope**: Account switching (→ 004_account_use.md), store initialization (→ 001_account_store_init.md).

### Design

`claude_profile` must copy `~/.claude/.credentials.json` to `{credential_store}/{name}.credentials.json`, creating or overwriting the named entry. It also snapshots `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json` as `{name}.claude.json` and `{name}.settings.json` to preserve rich account metadata for later enumeration by `.accounts`. The credential store path is resolved per FR-6 (see `001_account_store_init.md`).

**Name resolution** — when `name::` is omitted, the account name is inferred from `emailAddress` in `~/.claude.json`. If that field is absent, exits 1 with a clear message directing the user to pass `name::` explicitly.

**Name validation** — account names must be valid email addresses:
- Non-empty
- Must contain `@` with non-empty local part and domain

**Operation steps:**
1. Resolve name: use explicit `name::` if provided; otherwise read `emailAddress` from `~/.claude.json` via `parse_string_field`; if absent, exit 1.
2. Validate `name` against the rules above (exit 1 on violation).
3. Resolve credential store directory and ensure it exists (`create_dir_all` — see FR-6).
4. Read `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
5. Write contents to `{credential_store}/{name}.credentials.json` (creates or overwrites).
6. Copy `~/.claude.json` → `{credential_store}/{name}.claude.json` (best-effort: skip silently if source absent).
7. Copy `~/.claude/settings.json` → `{credential_store}/{name}.settings.json` (best-effort: skip silently if source absent).
8. Call `claude_quota::fetch_claude_cli_roles(&access_token)` (feature-gated, best-effort): on success, write response to `{credential_store}/{name}.roles.json`; on any failure, skip silently — save still succeeds.
9. Write `{credential_store}/_active_{hostname}_{user}` = `{name}` via `active_marker_filename()` — mark the saved account as the current active account (per-machine marker, see feature 025).

**Idempotency as metadata refresh:** `save()` overwrites all snapshot files on every invocation. Re-running `clp .account.save` for an existing account name re-fetches endpoint 005 and overwrites `{name}.roles.json` alongside all other snapshots. This is the canonical mechanism for refreshing cached metadata when org membership or role changes — no separate command required.

**Dry-run mode** (`dry::1`): Print `[dry-run] would save current credentials as '{name}'` without modifying any files.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-01**: `clp .account.save name::alice@acme.com` exits 0 and creates `{credential_store}/alice@acme.com.credentials.json`.
- **AC-02**: `clp .account.save name::` (empty) exits 1 with `account name must not be empty`.
- **AC-03**: `clp .account.save name::notanemail` exits 1 with `must be an email address`.
- **AC-04**: `clp .account.save name::alice@acme.com dry::1` prints `[dry-run] would save current credentials as 'alice@acme.com'` and creates no files.
- **AC-05**: When `~/.claude.json` exists, `{credential_store}/{name}.claude.json` is created alongside the credential file.
- **AC-06**: When `~/.claude/settings.json` exists, `{credential_store}/{name}.settings.json` is created alongside the credential file.
- **AC-07**: When `~/.claude.json` is absent, no `.claude.json` snapshot is created — save still succeeds.
- **AC-08**: `clp .account.save` (no `name::`) with `emailAddress` present in `~/.claude.json` infers the account name from that field and saves normally; output reads `saved current credentials as '{email}'`.
- **AC-09**: `clp .account.save` (no `name::`) when `~/.claude.json` has no `emailAddress` exits 1 with `cannot infer account name: emailAddress absent from ~/.claude.json — pass name:: explicitly`.
- **AC-10**: After a successful `clp .account.save`, `{credential_store}/_active_{hostname}_{user}` (the per-machine active marker) contains the saved account name; `clp .credentials.status` shows `Account: {name}` immediately.
- **AC-11**: `clp .account.save name::a/b@c.com` exits 1 — path-unsafe characters (`/`, `\`, `*`) in the email local part are rejected by `validate_name()` before any filesystem operation.
- **AC-12**: When endpoint 005 responds successfully, `{credential_store}/{name}.roles.json` is created alongside the credential file.
- **AC-13**: When endpoint 005 fails (network error, scope issue, or feature not enabled), no `{name}.roles.json` is written and save still exits 0.
- **AC-14**: Re-running `clp .account.save` for an existing account name overwrites `{name}.roles.json` with a fresh endpoint 005 response; this is the metadata refresh mechanism.
